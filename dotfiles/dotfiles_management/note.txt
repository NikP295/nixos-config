Format for the managed files list file:
1st line are the names, which are displayed at the start (choose what to backup)
Theyre separated by commas, no spaces, easy W

Second, the format for the locations is:
/path/to/original/location&/path/to/dotfiles/location


The paths are separated by a & which is not something that is usually found in file paths
